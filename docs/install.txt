Installing the latest development version of django-application-manager
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install, first check out the latest version of the application from
subversion:

    svn co http://django-application-manager.googlecode.com/svn/trunk django-application-manager

Now, link the inner ``application_manager`` project to your Python path:

    sudo ln -s `pwd`/application_manager SITE_PACKAGES_DIR/application_manager

If you don't know the location of your site packages directory, this hack might
do the trick for you::

    sudo ln -s `pwd`/application_manager `python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()"`/application_manager
    
Now it's installed!  Please see usage.txt for information on how to use this
